# Note-Recognition

To get started, follow the steps below:

 1. Install the following dependencies: tensorflow v1, flask, opencv
 2. Download the [semantic model](https://grfia.dlsi.ua.es/primus/models/PrIMuS/Semantic-Model.zip) developed by Calvo-Zaragoza et al.

## Run the Web App!
Once everything has been set up as above, head over to your terminal / command prompt. Change the directory to the directory with your `app.py` file and run `python app.py`. Wait for a few seconds and you should receive a message on the link you should go to in order to view the web app. Go to the URL, upload your music sheet and get the result!
